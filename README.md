# Webcryptobox
WebCrypto compatible encryption with Rust and its OpenSSL bindings.

This package implements the [Webcryptobox](https://github.com/jo/webcryptobox) encryption API.

Compatible packages:
* [Webcryptobox JavaScript](https://github.com/jo/webcryptobox-js)
* [Webcryptobox Bash](https://github.com/jo/webcryptobox-sh)

There is also a CLI tool: [wcb](https://github.com/jo/wcb-rs).

Convenient opinionated wrappers around [OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/latest/openssl/) to use [WebCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) compatible cryptography. Webcryptobox helps with elliptic curve key generation, derivation, fingerprinting, import and export as well as AES encryption and decryption.
